Shields and Hull
I'm using T1/2 T3/4 and T5/6.

Shields :
>85% = G/G/G
>70% = Y/G/G
>55% = R/G/G
>40% = R/Y/G
>25% = R/R/G
>10% = R/R/Y
<10% = R/R/R
Every coulour change of those buttons will make flash the changing button quickly :
last coulour/new coulour/last/new...

Hull :
100% = ON/ON/ON
>90% = flashing slowly/ON/ON
>60% = flashing slowly/flashing slowly/ON
>30% = flashing slowly/flashing slowly/flashing slowly
if the hull is damaged T buttons will flash ON/OFF
(Independentant of the colour of the buttons. If hull is damaged but the shields are UP, T buttons will flash green)

Weapons

A and B buttons
>80% = G / G
>60% = Y / G

Led functions

Range :

If the target is out of range :
- Fire button : off + E button : short and spaced flashs
If the target enters missile's range :
- Fire button and E button will flash together.
Then, closer the target is, faster the flashing.
and if the target is very close, fire button and E button are ON.

Target status :

E button colour will change (independent of the range)
If after a direct hit of the missile :
- only target's shields are damaged : red
- shields down and hull damage : yellow
- only spare parts left : green
And of curse it depends on the current target's status before the hit.
(be carefull, I never say that the missile will always hit)
