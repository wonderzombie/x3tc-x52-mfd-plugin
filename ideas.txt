If you have shields<15% and hull<20% ALL LEDs will flash red.
If the shields power up only the T LEDs continue to flash until hull is repaired, all other LEDs resume normal operation.


(A) LED: Selected missiles str compared to target:
 - off : no missile equipped
 - green : will cause only shield damage
 - yellow : will destroy shield and cause some hull damage
 - red : will blow target to tiny little pieces

 Fire LED:
 - off: no missile equipped
 - flashing speed shows targets range compared to equipped missiles range
 - slow flash: target too far
 - fast flash: target getting near enough
 - on : target in range

POV2 LED: target status
 - off : no target
 - green : friendly
 - yellow : neutral
 - red : enemy
 - red and flashing : enemy / stronger ship than yours (based on class/shield/hull)

(I) LED: closest incoming missile damage if hit:
 - off : no incoming missile 
 - green flashing - only shield damage
 - yellow flashing - hull damage expected
 - red - you will not survive
 

(E) LED: all incoming missiles damage if all hit:
 - off: no more incoming missile
 - green flashing - only shield damage
 - yellow flashing - hull damage expected
 - red - you will not survive


(B) LED: Laser energy
 - off : no weapons installed
 - green: 100 - 75%
 - yellow: 74 - 50 %
 - red:    49 - 20 %
 - red and flashing: <20%


(D) LED: ??? ideas welcome


Throttle LEDs: ship docked or 0 speed: off
	       ship moving : on
	       ship moving backward : flashing

 - normally these should need freight scanner but most of us know anyway that X ship has XY MJ/GJ shields normally, so I don't consider this a cheat

If there is an incoming missile pressing right MFD wheel will switch to Incoming missiles page.
